// Package meta provides interfaces for read / write interaction with models.
// a meta model holds all of the data for a single game.
// TODO: Evaluate if the enumeration interfaces ( NumEvent,GetEvent ) make sense -- a more generic "type" iteration might be better.
// TODO: Add interfaces for Querying, especially, but not only, for relations. ( probably key-object with property filter )
